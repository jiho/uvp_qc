# UVP lights quality control

`data` contains profiles with different levels of faulty lights

`read_data.R` reads and reformats that data

Each `filter-***.R` file implements one sort of filter and the results are represented in `plots`.
MATLAB and python implmentations of some filters are in Jupyter notebooks.

## TODO

- [ ] Add more example data
- [ ] Make it easier to prototype filters in any language
- [ ] Test more filters with more parameters
